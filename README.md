# Gluons UI Monorepo

Gluons is a Declarative Component Library built with React and Functional CSS

Most UI libraries require you to include their CSS, with the downside of not handling anything but the styling for those components.

Using a Functional CSS utility library to build the UI kit, also allows you to compose layouts quickly and reliably using the same small, reusable classes that power these components.

Hopefully Gluons kickstarts your React project and inspires your own components and layouts.
